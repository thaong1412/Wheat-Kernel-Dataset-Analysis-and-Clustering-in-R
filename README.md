# Wheat Kernel Dataset Analysis and Clustering

This project analyzes the `newseeds.csv` dataset, which contains measurements of geometrical properties of kernels from three wheat varieties. Using R, I explored the data through thorough statistical analysis and clustering techniques. Key tasks include:

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked for missing data programmatically.
- Investigated variable correlations.
- Counted seed varieties A, B, and C.

## 2. Analysis of Variable Differences
- Assessed if the seven variables differ across the three wheat varieties using statistical tests and visualizations.

## 3. K-means Clustering
- Applied K-means with 3 clusters.
- Justified whether data scaling is necessary.
- Visualized clusters and evaluated the clustering quality.

## 4. Silhouette Analysis
- Calculated silhouette scores and analyzed:
  - Number of negative scores.
  - Percentage of scores below 0.1.
  - Average silhouette scores for each cluster and overall.

## 5. Cluster Number Determination
- Used multiple approaches, including internal validation metrics and the Dunn index, to identify the optimal number of clusters.

This project highlights robust data analysis, clustering techniques, and clean, efficient R code.
